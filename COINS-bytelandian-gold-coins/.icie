A coin n\ncan be exchanged in a bank into three coins: n/2, n/3 and n/4.\nBut these numbers are all rounded down (the banks have to make a profit).\n<p>\nYou can also sell Bytelandian coins for American dollars. The exchange\nrate is 1:1. But you can not buy Bytelandian coins.\n<p>\nYou have one gold coin. What is the maximum amount of American dollars\nyou can get for it?\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe input will contain several test cases (not more than 10). Each\ntestcase is a single line with a number n, 0 <= n <= 1 000 000 000.\nIt is the number written on your coin.\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case output a single line, containing the maximum amount\nof American dollars you can make.\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n12\n2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n13\n2\n</pre>\n<p>\nYou can change 12 into 6, 4 and 3, and then change these into\n$6+$4+$3 = $13.\n<p>If you try changing the coin 2 into 3 smaller coins, you will get\n1, 0 and 0, and later you can get no more than $1$ out of them.\nIt is better just to change the $2$ coin directly into $2$.</p>\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.</div></aside>\n\t<body>\n</html>"}}}
