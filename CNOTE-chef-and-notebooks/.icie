Today, he has decided to write a <b>X</b> pages long poetry, but unfortunately his notebook has only <b>Y</b> pages left in it. Thus he decided to buy a new CHEFMATE notebook and went to the stationary shop. Shopkeeper showed him some <b>N</b> notebooks, where the number of pages and price of the <b>i</b><sup>th</sup> one are <b>P<sub>i</sub></b> pages and <b>C<sub>i</sub></b> rubles respectively. Chef has spent some money preparing for Ksen's birthday, and then he has only <b>K</b> rubles left for now.</p>\n<p>Chef wants to buy a single notebook such that the price of the notebook should not exceed his budget and he is able to complete his poetry.</p>\n<p>Help Chef accomplishing this task. You just need to tell him whether he can buy such a notebook or not. Note that Chef can use all of the <b>Y</b> pages in the current notebook, and Chef can buy only one notebook because Chef doesn't want to use many notebooks.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains an integer <b>T</b>, denoting the number of test cases. Then <b>T</b> test cases are follow.</p>\n<p>The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>K</b> and <b>N</b>, described in the statement. The <b>i</b><sup>th</sup> line of the next <b>N</b> lines contains two space-separated integers <b>P<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>C<sub>i</sub></b>, denoting the number of pages and price of the <b>i</b><sup>th</sup> notebook respectively.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, Print \"<b>LuckyChef</b>\" if Chef can select such a notebook, otherwise print \"<b>UnluckyChef</b>\" (quotes for clarity).</p>\n<h3>Constraints and Subtasks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1 ≤ T ≤ 10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1 ≤ Y &lt; X ≤ 10<sup>3<sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1 ≤ K ≤ 10<sup>3</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1 ≤ P<sub>i</sub>, C<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10<sup>3</sup></b></li>\n</ul></br>\n<p><b>Subtask 1: 40 points</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sum of <b>N</b> over all test cases in one test file does not exceed <b>10<sup>4</sup></b>.</li>\n</ul></br>\n<p><b>Subtask 2: 60 points</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sum of <b>N</b> over all test cases in one test file does not exceed <b>10<sup>6</sup></b>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sample</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input</b>\n3\n3 1 2 2\n3 4\n2 2    \n3 1 2 2\n2 3\n2 3    \n3 1 2 2\n1 1\n1 2\n<p><b>Output</b>\nLuckyChef\nUnluckyChef\nUnluckyChef\n</pre></p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> In this case, Chef wants to write <b>X = 3</b> pages long poetry, but his notebook has only <b>Y = 1</b> page. And his budget is <b>K = 2</b> rubles, and there are <b>N = 2</b> notebooks in the shop. The first notebook has <b>P<sub>1</sub> = 3</b> pages, but Chef cannot buy it, because its price is <b>C<sub>1</sub> = 4</b> rubles. The second notebook has <b>P<sub>2</sub> = 2</b> pages, and its price is <b>C<sub>2</sub> = 2</b> rubles. Thus Chef can select the second notebook to accomplish the task. He will write <b>1</b> page of poetry in the old notebook, and <b>2</b> page of poetry in the new notebook.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b> Chef cannot buy any notebook, because the prices exceed the Chef's budget.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 3.</b> No notebook contains sufficient number of pages required to write poetry.</p>\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.</div></aside>\n\t<body>\n</html>"}}}
