Telangana has a unique structure: the capital in the center and n cities in a circle around the Hyderabad. The Hyderabad already has a good network coverage (so the government ignores it), but the $i-th$ city contains $ai$ (like $a1,a2$...) households that require a connection.</p>\n<p>The government designed a plan to build n network stations between all pairs of neighboring cities which will maintain connections only for these cities. In other words, the $i-th$ network station will provide service only for the i-th and the $(i+1)-th$ city (the $n-th$ station is connected to the $n-th$ and the $1-st$ city).</p>\n<p>All network stations have capacities: the i-th station can provide the connection to at most bi households.</p>\n<p>Now the government asks you to check can the designed stations meet the needs of all cities or not that is, is it possible to assign each household a network station so that each network station i provides the connection to at most $bi$ (like $b1,b2$..) households.</p>\n<h3>Input:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line contains a single integer t (1&lt;=t&lt;=104) the number of test cases.</li>\n<li>The first line of each test case contains the single integer n (2&lt;=n&lt;=106) the number of cities and stations.</li>\n<li>The second line of each test case contains n integers (1&lt;=ai&lt;=109) the number of households in the i-th city.</li>\n<li>The third line of each test case contains n integers (1&lt;=bi&lt;=109) the capacities of the designed stations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Output:</h3>\n<p>For each test case, print YES, if the designed stations can meet the needs of all cities, or NO otherwise.</p>\n<h3>Sample Input:</h3>\n<pre><code>    2\n    3\n    2 3 4\n    3 3 3\n    4\n    2 3 4 5\n    3 7 2 2\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Sample Output:</h3>\n<pre><code>    YES\n    NO</code></pre>\n\n\t<body>\n</html>"}}}
