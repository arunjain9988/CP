Both the players takes turns alternatively, and $P_1$ goes first. Rules of the game are as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In $P_1$’s turn, he should choose any element $A_i$ which is $\\ge 1$, and subtract $1$ from it.</li>\n<li>In $P_2$’s turn, he should choose any element $A_i$ which is $\\ge 2$, and subtract $2$ from it.</li>\n<li>The player who is not able to make a move loses.\nGiven the array $A$, find the number of different indices $i$ such that that $P_1$ can subtract from $A_i$ in his first turn, and end up winning the game, if both the players play optimally after this.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.</li>\n<li>The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$.</li>\n<li>The second line of each test case contains $n$ space-separated integers denoting the array $A$.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output an integer corresponding to the number of possible first moves of $P_1$ that lead him to win.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>$1 \\le T \\le 10^5$</li>\n<li>$1 \\le n \\leq  10^5$</li>\n<li>$1 \\le A_i \\leq 10^5$</li>\n<li>Sum of $n$ over all the test cases doesn't exceed $10^6$</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example Input</h3>\n<pre><code>3\n1\n1\n1\n3\n2\n1 2\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Example Output</h3>\n<pre><code>1\n0\n1\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><strong>Testcase 1</strong>: The array is {1}. $P_1$ has no choice but to pick the element and subtract 1 from it. The resulting array is {0}, and now $P_2$ is unable to make a move. Hence $P_1$ wins, and there was only one winning first move. Hence the answer is 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Testcase 2</strong>: The array is {3}. $P_1$ has no choice but to pick the element and subtract 1 from it. The resulting array is {2}, and now $P_2$ has no choice but to subtract 2 from it. The resulting array is {0}, and now $P_1$ is unable to make a move. Hence $P_1$ loses.There is no starting move for $P_1$ which leads to his victory. Hence the answer is 0.</p>\n<p><strong>Testcase 3</strong>: The array is {1, 2}. $P_1$ has two choices. Either subtract 1 from 1 or subtract 1 from 2. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suppose he subtracts 1 from the first element, then the resulting array is {0, 2}, and now $P_2$ has no choice but to subtract 2 from the second element. The resulting array is {0, 0}, and now $P_1$ is unable to make a move. Hence $P_1$ loses in this case.</li>\n<li>But suppose he subtracts 1 from the second element, then the resulting array is {1, 1}, and now $P_2$ is unable to make a move. Hence $P_1$ wins in this case.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus, there is exactly one starting move for $P_1$ which leads to his victory. Hence the answer is 1.</p>\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.</div></aside>\n\t<body>\n</html>"}}}
