He decided to automate the interview process to save time. The server asks $N$ problems to the interviewee and stores the amount of time a candidate takes to solve each problem. More formally, the data is stored as an array $A$, where the $i$-th integer $A_i$ denotes the time (in seconds) the candidate took to solve the $i$-th problem.<br />\nNote that $A_i$ = $-1$ denotes that the candidate was not able to solve the $i$-th problem at all. Can you help Ashish automate the process by writing a code to find the verdict of the interview?</p>\n<p>The verdict can be one of the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rejected:</strong> If the number of problems that the candidate solved is strictly less than $ceil(N/2)$.</li>\n<li><strong>Too Slow:</strong> If candidate is not <strong>Rejected</strong> and candidate took more than $K$ seconds to solve at least one problem among the problems solved by the candidate.</li>\n<li><strong>Bot:</strong>  If candidate is neither <strong>Rejected</strong> nor <strong>Too Slow</strong>, but has solved all of the $N$ problems in at most one second each.</li>\n<li><strong>Accepted:</strong> If the candidate is neither <strong>Rejected</strong>, <strong>Too Slow</strong>, nor <strong>Bot</strong>, she is <strong>Accepted</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.</li>\n<li>The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers - $N$ and $K$ respectively.</li>\n<li>The second line of each test case contains $N$ space separated integers - $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For each testcase, output a single line containing the verdict of the interview.</li>\n<li>The judge is <strong>case-insensitive</strong> so if the answer is <strong>Accepted</strong> then any one of <strong>accepted</strong>, <strong>aCCepted</strong>, <strong>ACCEPTED</strong>, etc will be considered as a correct answer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>$1 \\leq T \\leq 10^4$</li>\n<li>$6 \\leq N \\leq 100$</li>\n<li>$30 \\leq K \\leq 60$</li>\n<li>$-1 \\leq A_i \\leq 120$</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Subtasks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>100% points - Original constraints</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example Input</h3>\n<pre><code>5\n7 30\n-1 0 4 -1 -1 40 -1\n6 30\n1 0 1 1 1 0\n6 44\n1 1 1 1 -1 0\n7 31\n2 3 42 -1 -1 -1 4\n6 60\n1 -1 0 60 -1 -1\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Example Output</h3>\n<pre><code>Rejected\nBot\nAccepted\nToo Slow\nAccepted\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Example case 1:</strong> There are $N=7$ problems but candidate was able to solve only $3$ of them which is less than $ceil(N/2)$ and hence the verdict is <strong>Rejected</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Example case 2:</strong> The candidate solved all the problems and took at most $1$ second to answer each one of them. Hence the verdict is <strong>Bot</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Example case 3:</strong> The candidate solved $5$ out of $N=6$ problems. The verdict is not <strong>Too Slow</strong> as $K=44$. The verdict is also not <strong>Bot</strong> because candidate couldn't solve all of the $N=6$ problems. Hence the verdict is <strong>Accepted</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Example case 4:</strong> The candidate solved $4$ out of $N=7$ problems but took $42$ seconds to answer the $3$-rd problem which is more more than $K=31$. Hence the verdict is <strong>Too Slow</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\t<body>\n</html>"}}}
